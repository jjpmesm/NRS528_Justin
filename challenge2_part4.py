# Ask the user for an input of their current age, and tell them how many years until they reach retirement (65 years old).

# Hint:

# age = int(24)
# print ("Your age is " + str(age))
#
# retire_age = int(65)
# age = int(24)
# time_to_retirement = (retire_age - age)
# print (str(time_to_retirement) + " years to retirement.")

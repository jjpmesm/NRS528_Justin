## Background

Hi everyone!

My name is Justin Purcell and I’m from River Vale New Jersey, where I am only a few minutes away from New York State. 

I'm a graduate student in my second semester of the Master's in Environmental Science in Management (MESM) Program and I’m specializing in Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis. I have interests in wildlife management and environmental science studies, and I hope to apply GIS/remote sensing to this field of work. Additionally, I hope to further advance my skillset with the addition of Python. 

I graduated from URI as in 2020 with a B.S. in Wildlife Conservation Biology. My field work in between my academic career consisted of endangered shorebird conservation and waterfowl surveys/management. I realized the importance and diverse applications of GIS/remote sensing from my undergraduate coursework and field work. 

## Interests


I enjoy any outdoor activities, especially hiking or fishing. Even though I grew up in a suburban neighborhood, there were still plenty of opportunities for me to explore the great outdoors. I developed the hobby of birdwatching from family members, which had an influence on my undergraduate study of interest. I also love physical fitness activities such as mixed martial arts and working out at a gym. 

I look forward to getting to know my fellow classmates by the end of the semester! Please feel free to reach out in class or by my contact information below:
